_Abstract: Against the background of remunicipalisation trends in European public service sectors, this paper estimates firm-level productivity for German electricity retailers and tests whether the ownership type has a significant impact on productivity. We specify a production function for the retail sector with labour and external services as main inputs, which is estimated using a control function approach. Employing a newly constructed dataset on German utilities by the German Federal Statistical Office for the years 2003-12, we find that firm-level productivity generally increased until 2008 but not afterwards. We do not find any evidence for ownership having an impact on productivity._

The empirical analysis was done in `R`. In this repository you find all statistical programs necessary to conduct the analyses in the paper. See [here](https://gitlab.com/modern-state-owned-firms) for more information on the data sources and the linkage strategy to merge all the data sources.

The research was funded by the Leibniz Association while we were investigators in the research project "Kommunale Infrastrukturunternehmen zwischen Energiewende und demographischem Wandel" (2013-2016) at DIW Berlin.
