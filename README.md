The empirical analysis was done in `R`. In this repository you find all statistical programs to conduct the analyses in the article.

## Summary

_Against the background of remunicipalisation trends in European public service sectors, this paper estimates firm-level productivity for German electricity retailers and tests whether the ownership type has a significant impact on productivity. We specify a production function for the retail sector with labour and external services as main inputs, which is estimated using a control function approach. Employing a newly constructed dataset on German utilities by the German Federal Statistical Office for the years 2003-12, we find that firm-level productivity generally increased until 2008 but not afterwards. We do not find any evidence for ownership having an impact on productivity._

## Methods and data

### Firm-level data

 We use official microdata from the German Statistical Office.

- consisting of balance sheet and product data from German electricity firms covering the years 2003-12
- merging data sets from 9 different surveys

See [gitlab.com/modern-state-owned-firms](https://gitlab.com/modern-state-owned-firms) for more information on the data sources and the linkage strategy to merge all the data sources.

### Methods

We apply different statistical methods including 

- descriptive analyses
- panel data econometrics (GMM, structural estimation)
- regression techniques
- bootstrap
- hypotheses testing.

## Funding

The research was funded by the Leibniz Association while we were investigators in the research project "Kommunale Infrastrukturunternehmen zwischen Energiewende und demographischem Wandel" (2013-2016) at DIW Berlin.
